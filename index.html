              <p>The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat,
                 <br>is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae. Recent advances in
                 <br> archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred
                  <br>in the Near East around 7500 BC. </p>

        <br>primarily and specifically for work as sled dogs. 
       <br> It refers to a traditional northern type, notable for its cold-weather
        <br> tolerance and overall hardiness</p>
